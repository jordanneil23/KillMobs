KillMobs is a Bukkit plugin to kill ALL mobs on a server either at server boot or via a command after server boot.
This is basically a fail-safe for mob spawning plugins. If you've spawned too many mobs or too large of a slime, this plugin can help kill those mobs to stop server lag.
The config.yml file is crucial to this plugin. It is where you list the mobs to be killed and what world they should be killed in.
This only support VANILLA mobs. I might add support for mod packs like ftb and tekkit later.
